  <h2>Hi My Princess Siri 💕</h2>
  <p id="typed">You are the most beautiful part of my life.
You make my bad days better and my good days unforgettable , but not everytime.
Still ,I don’t just love you… I feel lucky that you exist in my world. 
You can't even  image what you mean to me.
You are not just important to me — you are everything to me.</p>
